# K-Means-Clustering

Image Segmentation using K-Means Clustering :
Image segmentation is a technique in computer vision that divides an image into several parts.
The aim of this technique is to transform the image into a form that is easier to interpret and analyze. It helps to identify objects and draw boundaries around them.
Processing a whole image may not be efficient because some parts of the image may not have any relevant information. So, by segmenting the image,
we can focus on the important parts for processing. An image consists of a collection of pixels. Image segmentation groups pixels that have similar characteristics.
Image segmentation produces a mask for each object in the image that shows us more details and nuances of the object.
